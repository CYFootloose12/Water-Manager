Project - The Water Manager

This is a Django-based web application that is used with a microcontroller to help you keep track of watering your plants. The web app will communicate with the hardware, alerting you whenever there is no water in the water supply for the plant.

Run:

$python manage.py migrate

$python manage.py runserver

Go to http://www.localhost.com:8000/ 

Using the Django Documentation Website, I was able to find important information on how to implement different aspects of the web application.
For the jQuery and AJAX, I used www.w3schools.com for information on both of the technologies.
